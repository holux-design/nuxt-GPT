# Structured Response

This function allows you to request GPT to answer in a specific format defined with `zod`

```ts
const response = await useGPT('How high is Mt. Everest?')
.toStructured(
	z.object({
		meters: z.number()
	})
)
```

```ts
// Output:
{ meters: 8849 }
```

## `.toStructured(zodType)`

Sends the message but requests GPT to return the provided type.
Use [ZOD](https://zod.dev/) to define the return type.


## Useful Notes

Here is some information I stumbled upon while developing this:

- OpenAI's API is very selective about zod's types. It really only supports basic structures but nothing like e.g. `z.array(...).length()` or `.optional()`. 
- For nullable types there is a workaround with union: `z.union([z.<your-type>(), z.null()])`
