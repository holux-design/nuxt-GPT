# Security

The actual AI requests are placed in API Endpoints as `/api/chat-gpt/functions/<endpoint>`. To enforce API security, one-time tokens are issued upon request in combination with a server middleware. These tokens are only valid for 2 seconds and only need to last until the actual request has been processed.
